      "title": "About us",
      "content": "90Min Retro Shirts is a fictional webshop fully focused on the sale of football shirts from clubs and national teams. The webshop combines retro designs with modern releases, offering a unique selection of shirts for both nostalgic football fans and contemporary supporters. Think of classic shirts from the 90s, exclusive collaborations such as AC Milan x Off-White, and the latest home shirts for EURO 2024.\n\nThe webshop was created with the idea that every football fan should be able to find something that suits them. That‚Äôs why the collection includes a diverse range: from colorful vintage jerseys to sleek black designs. For this reason, color blindness was also taken into account: key buttons, actions, and text contrast are designed to stand out visually for people with various forms of color blindness, such as red-green color blindness. Contrast was a conscious design choice, just like clear icons and labels that aren‚Äôt solely color-based.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the site is built in a modern way. The navigation is intuitive, and visitors can easily browse by category, team, or competition. Through a broad dropdown menu or search function, they can quickly find their favorite shirt. The homepage highlights popular and new shirts using an interactive slider.\n\nThe Terms & Conditions clearly state this. It is also mentioned that products are only available in one size in order to comply with regulations.\n\nThe webshop is fully bilingual (Dutch and English) and responsively designed for both desktop and mobile use. The shopping cart, checkout process, and user registration have been simulated to create a realistic user experience."

    "colorblindness": {
      "title": "Color Blind Accessibility in Webshops",
      "content": "When designing a webshop, accessibility should always be considered. A commonly overlooked user group is people with color blindness. About 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women experience some form of color blindness. This means a significant portion of your potential customers may struggle to distinguish certain colors, negatively impacting their user experience. With smart design decisions, your webshop can become more inclusive and ensure that no one gives up shopping unnecessarily.\n\nWhat is color blindness and what issues arise on a webshop?\nColor blindness (daltonism) occurs when the cones in the eye responsible for color perception function poorly. The most common forms include protanomaly (difficulty with red and green), deuteranomaly (difficulty with green and red), and tritanomaly (difficulty with blue and yellow).\nMany webshops rely heavily on color to make buttons, errors, and product options clear. Color blind users may:\n- Have trouble reading text and buttons with low contrast\n- Struggle with navigation if links and buttons rely solely on color\n- Misunderstand error messages if only shown in red\n- Experience issues selecting products if options are only visually indicated without text\n\nFortunately, there are several simple steps to improve accessibility:\n1. Avoid problematic color combinations\n2. Ensure sufficient contrast\n3. Use icons and patterns in addition to color\n4. Make links and buttons extra recognizable\n5. Test your webshop with color blindness simulators\n6. Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\n\n\t**Sources:**\n- WebAim (2021). *Visual Disabilities*.
